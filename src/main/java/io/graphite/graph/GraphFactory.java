/**
 * Factory responsible for creating concrete graph implementations.
 *
 * <p>{@code GraphFactory} centralizes graph instantiation, ensuring that
 * graph construction remains consistent throughout the framework.
 * Instead of exposing constructors directly, builders and generators
 * delegate object creation to this factory.</p>
 *
 * <p>The factory selects the appropriate graph implementation based on
 * the supplied {@link GraphConfiguration}, including directed,
 * undirected, mutable, and immutable variants.</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Graph graph = GraphFactory.undirected(configuration);
 * }</pre>

 * <h2>Design</h2>

 * <ul>
 *     <li>Centralizes graph creation.</li>
 *     <li>Encapsulates implementation selection.</li>
 *     <li>Supports the Factory design pattern.</li>
 *     <li>Used internally by builders and generators.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class is intended primarily for internal framework use.
 * Applications should create graphs through {@link Graphs}.</p>
