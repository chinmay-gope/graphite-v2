/**
 * Implements Kosaraju's algorithm for finding Strongly Connected Components
 * (SCCs) in directed graphs.
 *
 * <p>Kosaraju's algorithm identifies maximal groups of vertices where every
 * vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the same group. The
 * algorithm performs two depth-first searches: one to compute vertex finish
 * times and another on the transposed graph to discover strongly connected
 * components.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Requirements</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The graph must be directed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>
 *
 * <p>The algorithm performs a DFS to compute finishing order, reverses all
 * graph edges, and performs a second DFS in decreasing finish-time order to
 * identify each strongly connected component.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Complexity</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Time: O(V + E)</li>
 *     <li>Space: O(V)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>When to Use</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Finding strongly connected components.</li>
 *     <li>Analyzing dependency graphs.</li>
 *     <li>Compiler optimization.</li>
 * </ul>
